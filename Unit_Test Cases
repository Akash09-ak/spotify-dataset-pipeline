 Input Validation and Handling:
1. Empty DataFrame: Verify the function handles empty DataFrames without errors.  
2. All Missing Values: Confirm the function handles DataFrames with all missing values appropriately.  
3. Correct File Format: Ensure the function checks for a valid file format (e.g., CSV).  
4. Invalid Data Types: Test if the function raises appropriate errors for invalid data types (e.g., non-numeric values in numeric columns).  
5. Unnecessary Columns: Validate that unnecessary columns are identified and removed correctly.  
6. Duplicate Rows: Check if duplicate rows are identified and removed as expected.  

 Data Transformation:
7. Radio Mix Categorization: Test if the `radio_mix` column is accurately calculated based on the `duration_ms` column.  
8. Explicit Track Filtering: Verify that explicit tracks are correctly filtered out.  
9. Popularity Filter: Ensure tracks with popularity below a specified threshold are excluded.  

 Data Storage:
10. Successful Load: Confirm the DataFrame is successfully loaded into the SQLite database.  
11. Data Integrity: Verify that data is loaded without loss or corruption and retains its accuracy.
